KDE Development
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="card">
![Picture from Barcelona's Akademy talk about Consistency.](MainAssets/kdeselfie.jpg)

I have joined KDE development roughly in 2018/2019. I lead the **Consistency** - selected at 2019's Akademy - effort for three years; I've done various code and style contributions to Plasma (e.g. **floating panels**) and I've helped out with the work of the Promotional group (e.g. by orginizing **wallpaper contests**).

<summary>CONTRIBUTIONS</summary>
    <details>
        <summary>Plasma Panel Work</summary>
        ![Picture of the floating panel](MainAssets/floatingpanel.png)
        I've implemented various improvements to the default Plasma Panel: I've added a toggle to make panels floating, I've added a "Margin Areas" widget that helps keeping icon/text sizes consistent in the panel, I've refactored most of its code to improve stability, and so on.
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Plasma Style Improvements</summary>
        ![Pictured here: PlasmoidHeading, blur, separator lines and rounded corners.](MainAssets/plasmawidget.png)
        I have added the PlasmoidHeading component currently used in most out-of-the-box widgets; I've re-worked the default values of the "Contrast Effect" and svg transparency to provide a more blurry look out of the box. I've added various minor elements, such as separator lines between the panel and widgets, outlines, rounded corners, and so on. I've also spend various months completely redesigning the shadows of dialogs.

        In 2019 I was elected the goalkeeper of the Consistency goal during Akademy. For the following three years I have worked towards making the style of Plasma and KDE apps as consistent as possible, with yearly talks on the ongoing process.

I also started working in scripting and editing videos and newsletters for **TechHut**, a technology channel with **150.000** subscribers.

Programming

<div class="card">
![An application to analyse Ultimate Tic Tac Toe games](MainAssets/ultris.png)

KDE contributions aside, I've created various personal projects over the time. I'm currently working on structuring them further to make sure they're maintained and potentially useful.

These range from games (Ultimate Tic Tac Toe and Interactive Fictions), to telegram bots, to a full proof-of-concept programming language. I've also wrote part of the riddle at the Python Italian Conference in 2022.

        <summary>Programming Language</summary>

        ![The logo](MainAssets/nylo.png)

        **Nylo** is a declarative programming language. It takes some constructs from functional and logic paradigms, but it‚Äôs really a new paradigm itself. It aims to be simple and clear, but powerful. It provides an easy way to make assertions on the data a function is working on. It also gives you the possibility to define standard behaviour if asserts fail.

    <details>
        <summary>Telegram Bot Maker</summary>

        **TyTg** allows users to navigate in a folder in a hosting pc. Directories are shown as Telegram buttons, allowing the creation of custom bots. Also, *.txt files are sent as messages, *.png &co are sent as images. You can also create *.tgfile containing a Telegram ID to send files. This allows to create bots by simply managing directories.
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Interactive Fiction Maker</summary>

        **Fyct** is a multiplayer interactive fiction engine that supports the creation of very complex text adventures. It supports fighting, inventary with limited space, day vs night time, hunger and thirst, temperatures, an health system with sicknesses, and so on.

    <details>
        <summary>Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Board</summary>

        **Ultris** is an application made to analyse games of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe. If you don't know about UTTT, it is a variant of Tic Tac Toe that's not yet solved and quite fun to play.

        <summary>Markdown to Telegram Bot</summary>

        **Gram** is a Python script that allows you to create a simple Telegram Bot simply by extracting the necessary information by a Markdown file. This makes it possible to create simple bots very quickly.

üìú Poetry and Art
===============================================================================

Poetry
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="card">
![](MainAssets/apoem.jpg)

I write poetry almost daily. It is in Italian. Its main focus is love, and all the circumstances where it ends up hurting all the people involved instead of being a positive driving force. I also focus on rhymes and wordplay with sounds.


<details>
<summary>PORTFOLIO</summary>
    <details>
        <summary>2021-2023: Metrica e Ritmi di Ragazze che Crescono</summary>
        Since 2021 I'm working on a more serious collection called (for now) **"Metrica e Ritmi di Ragazze che Crescono"** (which roughly translates to "Metric and Rhytms of Girls Growing Up"), containing fictional stories regarding girls facing the troubles in the grown-ups world which is changing around them. I plan to actually print and sell this, and also to contact different artists to make this not a poetry book, but rather a mix of a poetry and illustrations book.
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>2020: Non Sono Che Suoni</summary>
        In 2020 I wrote a collection called **"Non Sono Che Suoni"** (which roughly translates to "Nothing But Sounds") which talks about a wet dream of a young boy. He dreams of approaching the girl he likes, then has flashbacks about the first time he met her, then gets lost into a variety of memories of her, eventually falling asleep with her. These poems are much longer, yet much less understandable. Although I think my rhyme-play peaked here, I basically never use these poems, for they're too obscure. I have commissioned one artist, Revelies, to draw five illustration for this collection.

        You can find it [here](MainAssets/nonsonochesuoni.pdf).
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>2019: Tutto L'Amore Brutto</summary>
        In 2019 I wrote a collection called **"Tutto l'Amore Brutto"** (which roughly translates to "All Ugly Love") which features many very short poems about a variety of fictional situations. This was rather early in my writing and only rarely do I read poems from this collection.

        You can find it [here](MainAssets/amorebrutto.pdf).

Nicco Loves Poetry
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="card">
With the goal of growing an audience around poetry/rhymes/rap, I publish daily videos talking about rap and metric. My main medium here is Tiktok, which seem to react well to videos with informations about rap songs. At the time of writing, I have over **7500** followers there, with the most watched video having **818k** views. I also sometimes try to upload on Instagram or my secondary Youtube channel as well.

A succession of numbers $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $L$ if, for each $\varepsilon$, there exist an element of the succession ($a_6$ in the example) after which all succession elements are distant to $L$ by less than $\varepsilon$.

All convergent sequences are bounded. If we pick any $\varepsilon$, we have by definition an element $a_n$ from which all following elements are within $(L+\varepsilon, L-\varepsilon)$; thus, they are bounded between these two values. All the elements *before* that element, instead, are a finite amount (from $a_1$ to $a_n$), which means that we can pick the largest and smallest values between those, and all of them will surely be bounded by these two values.

Sadly, I wasn't able to use colors for these graphs; Usually, I love playing with those ;)

Chess
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="card">
I currently train chess daily! I do puzzles on Lichess, I play games there, and I study the book *100 Endgames You Must Know*. I only play on Lichess. At the time of writing, the ratings I have are, roughly:

 Rapid  | Blitz | Bullet
--------|-------|------
 1900   | 1700  | 1600
 [Lichess ratings]

I will update this page with the score I get in rated tournaments. Meanwhile, you can find commented PNGs and studies of my games <a href="chess.html">at this link</a>.

Heads-up for anybody who'll play with me: I absolutely love playing the **Polish opening** with white and the **Scandinavian** (modern variation) with black, but please don't play the mainlines of these two openings, for they're so boring!

    You can find me in Lichess under the nickname `niccolove`!
